    <h1>Life of are child</h1>
    <p>Born on September 2008 in CWM hospital Fiji island .</p>
    <p>Raised in the house of steward in the South Pacific. I was raised seen my family playing rugby and more was learning the steps of respect passes down for generation. I came to New Zealand in 2022 and the first thing i experience was the different life from my country. Everthing was good things were cheap. My first school in NZ was Otahuhu college
	in South Aukland. The first class i experience was Gardening and it was the worst day becuase it was raining and plus i just wored my new as shoes which cost $200 and the work that was given to me was to mouch the grass which made my shoes dirty. </p>
